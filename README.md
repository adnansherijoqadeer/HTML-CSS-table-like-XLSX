## sample_tables.html
This is the example of what the final 3 files can look like. The files below, the ones you will edit, will be inserted into a page like:
https://www.incomebyzipcode.com/median-income-by-zip-code-list

These HTML tables act as product samples on landing pages. That's why they have "Sample" in the name.

## styles.css
We use bootstrap as the foundation and these custom styles for the HTML "spreadsheet".

## The files to edit
I've mentioned there are 3 html files to edit, here they are with the Excel Spreadsheet they are designed to mimic. 


### Income By Zip Code w/ Demographics
* IncomeByZipDemographicsSample.html
* IncomeByZipDemographicsSample.xlsx

### Income By Zip Code
This is a subset of Income By Zip Code w/ Demographics. the last two columns in the Excel file, geoid and land area, are not GREEN in the Excel file but they should be. They should be because column color alternates by topic. Since Land Area and GEOID are not the same topic as Households, it should be an alternate color, ie. green. It's an error in the Excel file.
